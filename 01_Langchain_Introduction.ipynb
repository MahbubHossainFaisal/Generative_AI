    "### Topic: LangChain Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to handle complex tasks like semantic search, text embeddings, and orchestrating multiple components in a system. Below, we’ll break down the key concepts and components of LangChain, along with examples, diagrams, and explanations in the simplest manner possible.\n",

    "## **1. How Semantic Search Works (with Example)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Semantic Search?**\n",
    "Semantic search is a technique that understands the meaning behind a user's query and retrieves relevant information based on context, rather than just matching keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "Imagine you have a database of superhero descriptions:\n",
    "- **Superman**: \"Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive.\"\n",
    "- **Batman**: \"The Dark Knight who protects Gotham City.\"\n",
    "- **Spider-Man**: \"Friendly neighborhood superhero with spider-like abilities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user searches for **\"Who can fly?\"**, a semantic search system will understand that \"fly\" is related to Superman, even if the word \"fly\" isn't explicitly mentioned in his description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "1. **Text Embedding**: Convert text into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture the meaning of the text.\n",
    "2. **Similarity Score**: Compare the embeddings of the query and the documents to find the most relevant matches.\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**: Return the documents with the highest similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Why Text Embedding is Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Text Embedding?**\n",
    "Text embedding is the process of converting text into numerical vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing computers to understand and compare text based on meaning rather than just words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it Needed?**\n",
    "- **Semantic Understanding**: Embeddings help machines understand the context and meaning of text.\n",
    "- **Efficient Search**: Embeddings enable fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.\n",
    "- **Similarity Comparison**: Embeddings allow us to calculate how similar two pieces of text are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "- The sentences **\"I love cats\"** and **\"I adore felines\"** will have similar embeddings because they convey the same meaning, even though the words are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Explain Similarity Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Similarity Score?**\n",
    "A similarity score is a numerical value that indicates how similar two pieces of text are. It is calculated by comparing their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How is it Calculated?**\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: A common method to calculate similarity. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.\n",
    "  - A score of **1** means the texts are identical.\n",
    "  - A score of **0** means the texts are completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "- Query: **\"Who can fly?\"**\n",
    "- Document 1: **\"Superman can fly.\"** (Similarity Score: 0.95)\n",
    "- Document 2: **\"Batman fights crime.\"** (Similarity Score: 0.10)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will return Document 1 because it has a higher similarity score.\n",
