    "## **1. Prompt Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the backbone of interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). They guide the model to generate the desired output. Let’s explore the most important prompt types in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Zero-Shot Prompting**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Zero-shot prompting involves asking the model to perform a task without providing any examples or prior context. The model relies entirely on its pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Ideal for tasks where the model has a general understanding but no specific training examples.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - **Prompt**: *\"Translate this sentence into French: 'Hello, how are you?'\"*\n",
    "  - **Output**: *\"Bonjour, comment ça va?\"*\n",
    "- **Why It’s Useful**:\n",
    "  - No need for task-specific examples.\n",
    "  - Works well for straightforward tasks like translation, summarization, or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Few-Shot Prompting**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Few-shot prompting provides the model with a few examples to guide its output. These examples act as a \"mini-training set\" for the model.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful when you want the model to follow a specific pattern or format.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - **Prompt**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Example 1: Translate \"Good morning\" into French -> \"Bonjour\"\n",
    "    Example 2: Translate \"Good night\" into French -> \"Bonne nuit\"\n",
    "    Now translate \"Hello, how are you?\" into French.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Output**: *\"Bonjour, comment ça va?\"*\n",
    "- **Why It’s Useful**:\n",
    "  - Helps the model understand the task better.\n",
    "  - Ensures consistency in output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting encourages the model to think step-by-step before generating the final answer. It mimics human reasoning.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Ideal for complex reasoning tasks like math problems, logical puzzles, or multi-step reasoning.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - **Prompt**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many apples does he have left?\n",
    "    A: John starts with 5 apples. He gives 2 to Mary. So, 5 - 2 = 3. John has 3 apples left.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Output**: *\"John has 3 apples left.\"*\n",
    "- **Why It’s Useful**:\n",
    "  - Improves accuracy for complex tasks.\n",
    "  - Makes the model’s reasoning process transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **d. Other Important Prompt Types**\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting**:\n",
    "   - The model is assigned a specific role to guide its responses.\n",
    "   - **Example**: *\"You are a helpful customer support agent. Answer the user's question: 'How do I reset my password?'\"*\n",
    "   - **Why It’s Useful**: Tailors the response to a specific context or persona.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instruction-Based Prompting**:\n",
    "   - The model is given explicit instructions to follow.\n",
    "   - **Example**: *\"Write a 100-word summary of the following text: [Insert Text].\"*\n",
    "   - **Why It’s Useful**: Ensures the output meets specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contextual Prompting**:\n",
    "   - The model is provided with context to generate relevant responses.\n",
    "   - **Example**: *\"Given the context of climate change, explain the importance of renewable energy.\"*\n",
    "   - **Why It’s Useful**: Generates context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Prompt Templates**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Prompt Templates?**\n",
    "Prompt templates are reusable structures for creating prompts. They allow you to define a format for inputs and dynamically fill in placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why are Prompt Templates Needed?**\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures prompts follow a consistent format.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Allows you to reuse the same template for different inputs.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating prompt generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Prompt Templates**\n",
    "- **Dynamic Inputs**: Easily insert variables into prompts.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle multiple inputs without rewriting prompts.\n",
    "- **Customization**: Tailor prompts for specific tasks or roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Prompt Template with Chat Models in LangChain**\n",
    "Imagine you want to create a chatbot that greets users by name. A prompt template can help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Template**: *\"Hello, {name}! How can I assist you today?\"*\n",
    "- **Input**: `name = \"Alice\"`\n",
    "- **Output**: *\"Hello, Alice! How can I assist you today?\"*\n",
    "\n",

    "## **3. Using Different Prompt Techniques in Prompt Templates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates can incorporate various prompt techniques to make them more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Few-Shot Prompting in a Template**\n",
    "- **Template**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Example 1: Translate \"Good morning\" into French -> \"Bonjour\"\n",
    "  Example 2: Translate \"Good night\" into French -> \"Bonne nuit\"\n",
    "  Now translate \"{phrase}\" into French.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Input**: `phrase = \"Hello, how are you?\"`\n",
    "- **Output**: *\"Bonjour, comment ça va?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompting in a Template**\n",
    "- **Template**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Q: If John has {x} apples and gives {y} to Mary, how many apples does he have left?\n",
    "  A: John starts with {x} apples. He gives {y} to Mary. So, {x} - {y} = {result}. John has {result} apples left.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Input**: `x = 5`, `y = 2`\n",
    "- **Output**: *\"John has 3 apples left.\"*\n",

    "## **4. Chains**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Chains?**\n",
    "Chains are sequences of operations that combine multiple steps (e.g., prompts, models, tools) into a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why are Chains Needed?**\n",
    "- **Complex Workflows**: Handle tasks that require multiple steps.\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Break down tasks into reusable components.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Automate multi-step processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Chains**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Combine different components (e.g., prompts, models, tools).\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle complex tasks with ease.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Reuse chains for similar tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: A Simple Chain**\n",
    "Imagine you want to summarize a text and then translate the summary into French. A chain can handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1**: Summarize the text.\n",
    "2. **Step 2**: Translate the summary into French.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code Example: Simple Chain in LangChain**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What is an Output Parser?**\n",
    "An output parser is a tool that structures the raw output of an LLM into a desired format (e.g., JSON, list, custom object).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why are Output Parsers Needed?**\n",
