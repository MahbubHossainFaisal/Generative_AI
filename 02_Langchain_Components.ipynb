    "### Topic: LangChain Components\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework that simplifies building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides modular components like **Models**, **Prompts**, **Chains**, **Indexes**, **Memory**, and **Agents** to handle various tasks. Below, we’ll break down each component with examples, diagrams, and explanations in the simplest manner possible.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Models?**\n",
    "Models are the core interfaces through which we interact with AI models from different companies. LangChain supports three main types of models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language Models (Text-to-Text)**:\n",
    "   - These models take text as input and generate text as output.\n",
    "   - Example: OpenAI's GPT-4, Hugging Face's T5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Models (Text-to-Vector)**:\n",
    "   - These models convert text into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture the meaning of the text.\n",
    "   - Example: OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Details of Available Models**:\n",
    "   - LangChain supports models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, Anthropic, and more.\n",
    "   - You can easily switch between models without changing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",
    "llm = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n",
    "response = llm(\"Explain quantum computing in simple terms.\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `llm = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4\")`: This creates an instance of the OpenAI model (GPT-4).\n",
    "- `response = llm(\"Explain quantum computing in simple terms.\")`: This sends a prompt to the model and stores the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Prompts**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Prompts?**\n",
    "Prompts are the inputs we provide to the LLM. They guide the model to generate the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Prompts in LangChain:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic and Reusable Prompts**:\n",
    "   - Prompts that can be reused with different inputs.\n",
    "   - Example: A template for summarizing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Role-Based Prompts**:\n",
    "   - Prompts tailored for specific user roles (e.g., customer, admin).\n",
    "   - Example: A customer support chatbot uses different prompts for customers and agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Few-Shot Prompts**:\n",
    "   - Prompts that include examples to guide the model.\n",
    "   - Example: Providing a few examples of translations to help the model translate new text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Other Important Types**:\n",
    "   - **Zero-Shot Prompts**: No examples are provided; the model generates output based on the prompt alone.\n",
    "   - **Chain-of-Thought Prompts**: Encourage the model to think step-by-step before answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"Explain {topic} in simple terms.\", input_variables=[\"topic\"])\n",
    "response = llm(prompt.format(topic=\"quantum computing\"))\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `PromptTemplate`: Creates a reusable prompt template.\n",
    "- `prompt.format(topic=\"quantum computing\")`: Fills the template with the specified topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Chains**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Chains?**\n",
    "Chains are pipelines that combine multiple steps (e.g., prompts, models, retrievers) into a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of a Simple Chain:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n",
    "response = chain.run(\"quantum computing\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `LLMChain`: Combines a prompt and an LLM into a chain.\n",
    "- `chain.run(\"quantum computing\")`: Runs the chain with the specified input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complex Pipelines:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel Chains**:\n",
    "   - Run multiple chains in parallel and combine their outputs.\n",
    "   - Example: Summarize a document and extract key entities simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditional Chains**:\n",
    "   - Run different chains based on conditions.\n",
    "   - Example: If the user asks for a summary, run a summarization chain; if they ask for a translation, run a translation chain.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **4. Indexes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Indexes?**\n",
    "Indexes connect your application to external knowledge sources like PDFs, websites, or databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components of Indexes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Loaders**:\n",
    "   - Load documents from various sources (e.g., PDFs, web pages).\n",
    "   - Example: `PyPDFLoader` for loading PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Splitters**:\n",
    "   - Split documents into smaller chunks for processing.\n",
    "   - Example: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Stores**:\n",
    "   - Store embeddings for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "   - Example: `FAISS`, `Pinecone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrievers**:\n",
    "   - Fetch relevant documents based on user queries.\n",
    "   - Example: `VectorStoreRetriever`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "1. **Upload a PDF**: A user uploads a PDF about superheroes.\n",
    "2. **Load the PDF**: Use a document loader to load the PDF.\n",
    "3. **Split the Text**: Use a text splitter to split the document into chunks.\n",
    "4. **Generate Embeddings**: Convert the chunks into embeddings.\n",
    "5. **Store Embeddings**: Store the embeddings in a vector store.\n",
    "6. **Retrieve Relevant Documents**: Use a retriever to fetch documents related to a user query (e.g., \"Who can fly?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Memory?**\n",
    "LLM API calls are stateless, meaning they don’t remember previous interactions. Memory allows you to persist state across calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation Buffer Memory**:\n",
    "   - Stores the entire conversation history.\n",
    "   - Example: Remembering all messages in a chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversation Buffer Window Memory**:\n",
    "   - Stores only the last `n` messages.\n",
    "   - Example: Remembering the last 5 messages in a chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summarizer-Based Memory**:\n",
    "   - Summarizes the conversation history to save space.\n",
    "   - Example: Summarizing a long chat into a few sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Memory**:\n",
    "   - Define your own memory logic.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing specific pieces of information (e.g., user preferences).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\n",
    "memory.save_context({\"input\": \"Hi\"}, {\"output\": \"Hello!\"})\n",
    "print(memory.load_memory_variables({}))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `ConversationBufferMemory`: Stores the conversation history.\n",
    "- `memory.save_context`: Saves a conversation context.\n",
    "- `memory.load_memory_variables`: Loads the stored memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What are AI Agents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Agents are advanced components in LangChain that enable LLMs to **perform tasks autonomously** by:\n",
    "1. **Reasoning**: Deciding which actions to take based on the user's query.\n",
    "2. **Using Tools**: Accessing external tools (e.g., APIs, databases, calculators) to gather information or perform tasks.\n",
    "3. **Iterating**: Taking multiple steps to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are ideal for tasks that require **dynamic decision-making** and **interaction with external systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example: AI Agent for Travel Planning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to build an AI Agent that helps users plan a trip. The agent will:\n",
    "1. **Search for flights** using a flight API.\n",
    "2. **Check the weather** at the destination using a weather API.\n",
    "3. **Recommend activities** based on the destination and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Agent Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Query**:\n",
    "   - The user asks the agent: *\"Plan a trip to Paris on October 15th. Check the weather and recommend activities.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Reasoning**:\n",
    "   - The agent **breaks the task into steps**:\n",
    "     - Search for flights to Paris on October 15th.\n",
    "     - Check the weather in Paris.\n",
    "     - Recommend activities based on the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Usage**:\n",
    "   - The agent uses **three tools** to perform the tasks:\n",
    "     - **Flight Search Tool**: Simulates searching for flights to the destination.\n",
    "     - **Weather Check Tool**: Simulates checking the weather at the destination.\n",
    "     - **Activity Recommendation Tool**: Recommends activities based on the destination and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execution**:\n",
    "   - The agent **executes each step**:\n",
    "     - It finds flights to Paris on October 15th.\n",
    "     - It checks the weather in Paris (e.g., sunny, 25°C).\n",
    "     - It recommends activities based on the weather (e.g., beach visit, hiking).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Response**:\n",
    "   - The agent combines the results and returns a response like:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Flights to Paris on October 15th: Flight XYZ123, $300\n",
    "     Weather in Paris: Sunny, 25°C\n",
    "     Recommended activities in Paris: Beach visit, hiking.\n",
