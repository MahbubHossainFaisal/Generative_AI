    "### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.1 Create a File for Anthropic Chat Model**\n",
    "Under the `ChatModels` folder, create a new file named `chatmodel_anthropic.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch ChatModels/chatmodel_anthropic.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2 Set Up the Anthropic API Key**\n",
    "You’ll need an API key from Anthropic to interact with their models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [Anthropic’s website](https://www.anthropic.com/) and create an account.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section and generate a new secret key.\n",
    "3. Add the API key to your `.env` file in the root folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `.env` file and add the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"<your_secret_key>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The `.env` file securely stores your API key, which will be loaded into your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Write the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `chatmodel_anthropic.py` file and add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Anthropic Claude model\n",
    "model = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3.5-sonnet-20241012\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define your prompt\n",
    "prompt = \"Explain the concept of neural networks in simple terms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Invoke the model with the prompt\n",
    "result = model.invoke(prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the result\n",
    "print(result.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Understand the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1 Import Libraries**\n",
    "- **`ChatAnthropic`**: This is the class provided by LangChain to interact with Anthropic’s chat models.\n",
    "- **`load_dotenv`**: This function loads environment variables from the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2 Load Environment Variables**\n",
    "- **`load_dotenv()`**: This ensures that the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3 Initialize the Anthropic Model**\n",
    "- **`ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3.5-sonnet-20241012\")`**: This initializes the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. You can replace the model name with other versions if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.4 Define the Prompt**\n",
    "- **`prompt = \"Explain the concept of neural networks in simple terms.\"`**: This is the input text that will be sent to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.5 Invoke the Model**\n",
    "- **`model.invoke(prompt)`**: This sends the prompt to the model and retrieves the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.6 Print the Result**\n",
    "- **`print(result.content)`**: The response from the model is stored in `result.content`, which is then printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Run the Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the script to see the model’s response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python ChatModels/chatmodel_anthropic.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Expected Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the script, you should see an output similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (called neurons) that process and transmit information. Each neuron takes in input, performs a simple computation, and passes the result to the next layer. By adjusting the connections between neurons, neural networks can learn to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Customize the Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can experiment with different prompts to see how the model responds. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script again, and you’ll get a creative story generated by Claude!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 7: Additional Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Versions**: Anthropic offers multiple versions of Claude. You can experiment with other models like `claude-3-opus` or `claude-3-haiku` by changing the `model` parameter.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Temperature and Max Tokens**: You can customize the model’s behavior by adding parameters like `temperature` (controls randomness) and `max_tokens` (limits response length). For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3.5-sonnet-20241012\", temperature=0.7, max_tokens=200)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling to manage API rate limits or connectivity issues. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = model.invoke(prompt)\n",
    "       print(result.content)\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
