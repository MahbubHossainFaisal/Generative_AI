    "### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.1 Install Required Libraries**\n",
    "Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If you haven’t already, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "langchain-huggingface\n",
    "transformers\n",
    "sentence-transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, install the libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Write the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file under the `EmbeddedModels` folder named `huggingface_embedding.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch EmbeddedModels/huggingface_embedding.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code to the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class\n",
    "from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Hugging Face embedding model\n",
    "embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list of documents\n",
    "documents = [\n",
    "    \"Delhi is the capital of India\",\n",
    "    \"Kolkata is the capital of West Bengal\",\n",
    "    \"Paris is the capital of France\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate embeddings for the documents\n",
    "vector = embedding.embed_documents(documents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the embeddings\n",
    "print(str(vector))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Understand the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1 Import Libraries**\n",
    "- **`HuggingFaceEmbeddings`**: This is the class provided by LangChain to interact with Hugging Face’s embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2 Initialize the Embedding Model**\n",
    "- **`HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`**: This initializes the Hugging Face embedding model. The `model_name` parameter specifies the model to use. In this case, we’re using the **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model, which is a lightweight and efficient sentence transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3 Define the Documents**\n",
    "- **`documents`**: This is a list of sentences for which we want to generate embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.4 Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "- **`embedding.embed_documents(documents)`**: This sends the list of documents to the embedding model and retrieves their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.5 Print the Embeddings**\n",
    "- **`print(str(vector))`**: The embeddings are stored in the `vector` variable and printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Run the Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the script to see the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python EmbeddedModels/huggingface_embedding.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Expected Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the script, you should see an output similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[[0.012345, -0.023456, 0.034567, -0.045678, 0.056789, ...],\n",
    " [0.098765, -0.087654, 0.076543, -0.065432, 0.054321, ...],\n",
    " [0.123456, -0.112345, 0.101234, -0.090123, 0.078901, ...]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Each sublist represents the embedding vector for the corresponding document in the `documents` list. The length of each vector depends on the model (e.g., **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** generates 384-dimensional vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Customize the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6.1 Use a Different Model**\n",
    "You can use other models from Hugging Face’s Model Hub. For example, replace `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` with `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6.2 Generate Embeddings for a Single Document**\n",
    "If you want to generate an embedding for a single sentence, use the `embed_query` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sentence = \"Berlin is the capital of Germany.\"\n",
    "vector = embedding.embed_query(sentence)\n",
    "print(str(vector))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 7: Additional Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection**: Hugging Face offers a wide range of embedding models. Choose one based on your use case:\n",
    "   - **Lightweight**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
    "   - **High Performance**: `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Always include error handling to manage API rate limits or connectivity issues. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       vector = embedding.embed_documents(documents)\n",
    "       print(str(vector))\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch Processing**: If you have a large number of documents, you can process them in batches to avoid memory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "- Explore other embedding models on Hugging Face, such as **paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2** or **multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1**.\n",
    "- Use embeddings to build a semantic search engine or recommendation system.\n",
    "- Compare the performance of different embedding models for your specific use case."
