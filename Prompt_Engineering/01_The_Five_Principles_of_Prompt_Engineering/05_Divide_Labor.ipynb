    "### **Principle 5: Divide Labor ‚Äì The Art of Chunking Complex Tasks**  \n",
    "For ambitious goals (e.g., writing a research paper, coding a full-stack app), **breaking work into smaller, AI-manageable steps** yields better results than a single monolithic prompt. This mirrors how humans tackle complexity‚Äîdivide, conquer, and assemble.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Dividing Labor Matters**  \n",
    "1. **Avoids Overload**: AI performs worse when asked to do too much at once.  \n",
    "2. **Improves Accuracy**: Each step gets focused attention (e.g., research ‚Üí outline ‚Üí draft ‚Üí refine).  \n",
    "3. **Enables Iteration**: Fix errors early instead of rewriting a massive output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- ‚ùå *\"Write a 10-page whitepaper on blockchain in healthcare.\"* ‚Üí Likely produces a disorganized mess.  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Divide into steps**:  \n",
    "  1. *\"List 5 key challenges blockchain solves in healthcare.\"*  \n",

    "#### **1. Map the Workflow**  \n",
    "Identify natural breakpoints in your task:  \n",
    "- **Research**: Gather data/ideas.  \n",
    "- **Structure**: Organize logically (outlines, schemas).  \n",
    "- **Execute**: Generate content/code.  \n",
    "- **Polish**: Edit, validate, format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Template**:  \n",
    "*\"We‚Äôre doing [task]. First, [step 1]. Then, [step 2]. Finally, [step 3].\"*  \n",

    "#### **2. Chain Prompts with Context**  \n",
    "Pass outputs from one step as inputs to the next:  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "# Step 1: Brainstorm  \n",
    "\"List 5 blog topics about remote work productivity.\"  \n",
