    "### **Steps for Writing Step-by-Step Prompts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Identify the Task and Break It into Clear Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do when writing step-by-step prompts is to understand the overall task. Then, break that task into clear, actionable steps. Each step should be distinct and have a defined objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. **Chunk of Text** (Input)\n",
    "2. **Condense into a Single Sentence** (Step 1)\n",
    "3. **Translate the Summary** (Step 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This step-by-step approach makes the task clear to the LLM, reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the model knows exactly what to do at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Make the Instructions Simple and Actionable**\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the model understands exactly what you want, use simple and direct language. Make it clear what each step entails.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **\"Condense this text into a single sentence.\"**\n",
    "  - **Why?** It directly states what you need from the model without room for confusion.\n",
    "- **\"Translate this into Spanish.\"**\n",
    "  - **Why?** Simple and specific translation request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Prompt Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: The user will hand over a chunk of text enclosed in triple quotes. Your task is to condense this text into a single sentence, starting with the phrase \"Summary: \".**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Translate the summarization you made in Step 1 into Spanish, leading the translation with the phrase \"Translation: \".**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Each Step is Important:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Providing a Clear Starting Point**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: The user is asked to provide text enclosed in triple quotes.\n",
    "  - **Why?** This ensures that the LLM understands where the text begins and ends. It's clear what to expect as input, which prevents errors or confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Breaking Down the Task**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: You provide an actionable task like condensing the text into one sentence.\n",
    "  - **Why?** This makes it clear that the first action is to summarize the text. The model doesn't need to guess what you want—it knows it needs to distill the content into a short form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Define the Outcome**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Start with the phrase 'Summary:'\"\n",
    "  - **Why?** This ensures the output is formatted correctly from the start. It avoids any confusion about how the response should be structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Request a Second Action**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: After summarizing, the next task is to translate.\n",
    "  - **Why?** Giving the model a second, clear task (translation) lets it follow the logical order and execute multiple steps without having to ask for clarification in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tips for Writing Effective Step-by-Step Prompts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**:  \n",
    "   Break tasks into simple, specific actions so the model knows exactly what to do. For example, instead of saying, \"Summarize and translate,\" break it into \"Step 1: Summarize\" and \"Step 2: Translate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Clear Expectations**:  \n",
    "   Define what you want to see in the output at each step. For instance, \"Your summary should be no longer than one sentence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Direct Language**:  \n",
    "   Avoid vagueness. For example, instead of saying \"Simplify the text,\" say, \"Condense the text into one sentence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Include Context or Example**:  \n",
    "   If possible, give the model an example of how you want it to format its response. For example:\n",
    "   - \"Example: 'Summary: This is a short explanation of a complex topic.'\"\n",
    "   - This way, the model knows exactly how to structure the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check for Logical Flow**:  \n",
    "   Ensure that each step logically leads to the next. In the example provided, summarizing first and then translating ensures that the model performs tasks in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Step-by-Step Prompts Are Helpful:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Ambiguity**:  \n",
    "   By breaking down tasks into steps, the LLM knows exactly what to do at each stage, leading to more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Control of Output**:  \n",
    "   When you set a structure with clear instructions, you can better control how the output is formatted or structured. For instance, ensuring a summary starts with a specific phrase (\"Summary:\") or ensuring a translation is labeled clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved Task Efficiency**:  \n",
    "   Step-by-step prompts break down a larger task into smaller, manageable chunks, reducing the likelihood of confusion or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contextual Relevance**:  \n",
    "   With each step, you're directing the LLM to focus on one specific aspect of the task at a time. This ensures that each step’s output is focused and contextually relevant to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Example of a Well-Structured Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** \"Please condense the following paragraph into a single sentence. Start your summary with 'Summary:'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** \"Translate the summary you made in Step 1 into French. Begin the translation with 'Translation:'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this structure, you’re giving the model clear, actionable tasks, ensuring a more accurate and efficient outcome.\n"
