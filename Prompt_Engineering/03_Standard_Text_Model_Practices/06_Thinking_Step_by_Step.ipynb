    "# Step-by-Step Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Given Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the prompt you provided:\n",
    "**\"How many window washers are there in New York City? Let's think step by step:\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a **Fermi estimation prompt** with **step-by-step reasoning guidance**. It's asking the LLM to:\n",
    "1. Tackle a complex, real-world estimation problem\n",
    "2. Break it down into manageable components\n",
    "3. Show its reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Structure Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open-ended nature**: There's no single correct answer, allowing for creative problem-solving\n",
    "2. **Step-by-step instruction**: Guides the model to show its work rather than guessing\n",
    "3. **Real-world application**: Demonstrates how to approach practical estimation problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts Illustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Fermi Estimation\n",
    "Named after physicist Enrico Fermi, this technique involves making approximate calculations with limited data by breaking problems into smaller, estimable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "The \"think step by step\" instruction encourages the model to:\n",
    "- Decompose the problem\n",
    "- Make logical connections\n",
    "- Show intermediate reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Variations\n",
    "1. **Alternative phrasing**:\n",
    "   - \"Estimate the number of window washers in NYC by breaking down the problem\"\n",
    "   - \"Calculate approximately how many window washers work in NYC, showing each step\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Domain changes**:\n",
    "   - \"How many coffee shops are there in London? Let's think step by step:\"\n",
    "   - \"Estimate the number of electric vehicles in Los Angeles. Show your reasoning:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Variations\n",
    "1. **Multi-step verification**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   How many window washers are there in New York City?\n",
    "   1. First, estimate the total number of buildings with windows that need washing\n",
    "   2. Then, calculate how many window washers would be needed to service them\n",
    "   3. Finally, cross-validate your estimate with another approach\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assumption clarification**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Estimate the number of window washers in New York City:\n",
    "   - List all assumptions you're making\n",
    "   - For each assumption, explain why it's reasonable\n",
    "   - Then proceed with the calculation\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparative estimation**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Compare the number of window washers in New York City to:\n",
    "   - The number of firefighters\n",
    "   - The number of taxi drivers\n",
    "   Show how you derive each estimate and the ratios between them.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Effective Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be explicit about the reasoning process**:\n",
    "   - Bad: \"How many window washers in NYC?\"\n",
    "   - Good: \"Explain step-by-step how you would estimate the number of window washers in NYC\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encourage breakdowns**:\n",
    "   - \"Break this problem down into 3-5 smaller estimation problems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Request validation**:\n",
    "   - \"Provide two different methods to estimate this and compare results\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ask for assumptions**:\n",
    "   - \"List your key assumptions and how they affect the estimate\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Specify format**:\n",
    "   - \"Present your answer as: 1) Framework 2) Calculations 3) Final estimate\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Try crafting prompts to estimate:\n",
    "1. The number of pizzas consumed in Chicago in one week\n",
    "2. The total length of all escalators in Tokyo\n",
    "3. The weight of all the cars currently on Los Angeles freeways\n",
    "\n",
    "For each, practice:\n",
    "- The basic step-by-step version\n",
    "- An assumptions-clarifying version\n",
    "- A comparative estimation version\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vague instructions**: Not telling the model how you want it to think\n",
    "2. **Overly broad**: Not scoping the problem appropriately\n",
    "3. **No validation**: Not asking the model to check its own estimates\n",
    "4. **Ignoring assumptions**: Not having the model state its premises\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Technique: Meta-Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even prompt the model to help you build better prompts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I need to estimate the number of dog walkers in San Francisco. \n",
    "Help me design a step-by-step prompt that would:\n",
    "1. Break the problem into logical components\n",
    "2. Identify key data points needed\n",
    "3. Suggest ways to validate the estimate\n",
    "```"
