    "Writing effective prompts for sentiment analysis can help guide an AI model to understand the nuances of the text and classify it into the appropriate sentiment (neutral, negative, or positive). Here’s a breakdown of how to write effective prompts for sentiment analysis and some helpful tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Be Clear About the Task**\n",
    "   - **What works**: Your prompt should clearly explain that the task is to classify the sentiment of the text.\n",
    "   - **Example**:  \n",
    "     - \"Analyze the sentiment of the following customer review. The sentiment must be labeled as **negative**, **neutral**, or **positive** based on the overall tone of the review.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Provide Examples for Context**\n",
    "   - **What works**: Including example reviews with their correct sentiment labels helps the model understand the context and type of responses expected.\n",
    "   - **Example**:  \n",
    "     - \"Here are some examples of sentiment classifications for customer reviews:  \n",
    "       - Review: 'I recently purchased a marketing product from this company and I am so glad I did.' → Sentiment: **positive**  \n",
    "       - Review: 'This marketing product was a complete waste of time and money.' → Sentiment: **negative**  \n",
    "       - Review: 'This product is an effective marketing tool but has some drawbacks to consider.' → Sentiment: **neutral**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mention the Required Sentiment Labels**\n",
    "   - **What works**: Explicitly define the possible sentiment labels to ensure the model knows the categories.\n",
    "   - **Example**:  \n",
    "     - \"The sentiment of the review should be categorized into one of these three labels:  \n",
    "       - **positive**: When the customer is happy with the product or service  \n",
    "       - **negative**: When the customer is dissatisfied or has a poor experience  \n",
    "       - **neutral**: When the review is mixed or neutral in tone without strong feelings\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Provide Context and Tone**\n",
    "   - **What works**: Sometimes, the tone of the review may not be clearly positive or negative. Mentioning how the model should handle this can help.\n",
    "   - **Example**:  \n",
    "     - \"If the review mentions both positive and negative aspects but does not have a strong bias in either direction, classify the sentiment as **neutral**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Use Clear Instructions and Simple Language**\n",
    "   - **What works**: Avoid overly complex instructions or technical terms that could confuse the model. Make sure the request is simple and direct.\n",
    "   - **Example**:  \n",
    "     - \"Classify the sentiment of the following review into one of three categories: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.\"\n",

    "**Prompt**:  \n",
    "\"Please classify the sentiment of the following customer review into one of these three categories: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. A **positive** sentiment means the customer had a good experience and is satisfied, a **negative** sentiment means the customer had a bad experience or is dissatisfied, and a **neutral** sentiment means the review is neither strongly positive nor negative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Review**: 'I recently purchased a marketing product from this company and I am so pleased with the results. The product is easy to use and the customer service team was incredibly helpful.

    "### Key Tips for Writing Effective Sentiment Analysis Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Sentiment Labels Clearly**: Always be clear about the sentiment categories and what each one represents (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Provide Examples for Clarity**: Giving a few sample reviews with their respective sentiment labels can help the AI understand how to classify future reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Simple Language**: Keep the instructions straightforward so that there’s no ambiguity in what the AI is supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contextual Clarity**: In cases where the review contains both positive and negative aspects, specify how you want those mixed reviews to be classified (e.g., leaning towards positive or neutral).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensure Balanced Sentiment Distribution**: If you are working with a large dataset, aim to have a balance of positive, negative, and neutral reviews. This helps the AI model understand the variety of opinions it will encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Account for Nuances in Language**: Some reviews might be neutral but could still carry a tone of mild dissatisfaction or contentment. Specify how to handle these nuanced cases.\n",
