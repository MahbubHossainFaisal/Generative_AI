    "# Comprehensive Lesson on Prompt Engineering with Your Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an enhanced lesson that incorporates all of your prompt examples while explaining the underlying principles and providing additional variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Original Prompt Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Summarization**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes.\n",
    "   \"\"\"Insert text here\"\"\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dissertation Title Evaluation**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   In the following scenario, you will be given an abstract of a dissertation \n",
    "   and a proposed title for it. The name of the thesis should not only inform \n",
    "   the reader about its subject matter in a succinct manner but also be engaging. \n",
    "   Should the given title fall short of these requirements, kindly offer five \n",
    "   different alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Abstract: Please input abstract\n",
    "   Title: Please input title\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summary Comparison**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes.\n",
    "   \"\"\"My Father is Happy\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then compare the generated summary to the text delimited with square brackets []\n",
    "   [My dad is happy]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Provide a final answer of whether the summary and the [] text are similar \n",
    "   in meaning.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparative Article Analysis**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You will receive two articles (enclosed within HTML div tags) covering the \n",
    "   same subject. Initially, summarize the main points presented in each \n",
    "   article. Subsequently, determine which of the two presents a more \n",
    "   compelling argument and elaborate on your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div> insert first article here </div>\n",
    "   <div> insert second article here </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of Your Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input Specification Techniques\n",
    "- **Delimiters**: Using \"\"\" for text, [] for comparison, <div> for articles\n",
    "- **Placeholders**: \"Insert text here\" shows where user input goes\n",
    "- **Structured Inputs**: Separate fields for abstract and title\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Task Decomposition\n",
    "- Breaking complex tasks into clear steps (summarize → compare → judge)\n",
    "- Conditional operations (only suggest alternatives if title is inadequate)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Output Requirements\n",
    "- Specific output formats (five alternatives, similarity judgment)\n",
    "- Comparative evaluation (which is more compelling)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Summarization with Quality Control\n",
    "```\n",
    "Perform three-level text processing:\n",
    "1. Extract key phrases from \"\"\"text\"\"\"\n",
    "2. Generate a 25-word summary\n",
    "3. Evaluate summary against original for:\n",
    "   - Information retention (1-5)\n",
    "   - Fluency (1-5)\n",
    "   - Bias detection\n",
    "Return results as JSON\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Academic Title Optimization Engine\n",
    "```\n",
    "Act as a title optimization system with three filters:\n",
    "1. Clarity Check: Does it clearly reflect the abstract?\n",
    "2. Engagement Test: Would it attract readers in the field?\n",
    "3. SEO Scan: Does it contain important keywords?\n",
    "\n",
    "For any failed test:\n",
    "- Generate 3 specialized alternatives:\n",
    "  - One precision-focused\n",
    "  - One engagement-focused\n",
    "  - One balanced version\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: [insert]\n",
    "Proposed Title: [insert]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced Semantic Comparison\n",
    "```\n",
    "Conduct a multi-dimensional comparison:\n",
    "1. Summarize \"\"\"text A\"\"\"\n",
    "2. Compare with [text B] using:\n",
    "   - Cosine similarity of embeddings\n",
    "   - Key entity overlap\n",
    "   - Sentiment alignment\n",
    "3. Produce similarity score (0-1) with confidence percentage\n",
    "4. Highlight any significant discrepancies\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Forensic Article Analysis\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analyze two competing articles through:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Content Analysis:\n",
    "   - Argument structure mapping\n",
    "   - Evidence quality assessment\n",
    "   - Rhetorical device inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Comparative Evaluation:\n",
    "   - Strengths/weaknesses matrix\n",
    "   - Potential bias detection\n",
    "   - Audience appropriateness\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Improvement Plan:\n",
    "   - Hybrid ideal version outline\n",
    "   - Specific edits for each article\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>article 1</div>\n",
    "<div>article 2</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Principles Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision Input Handling**\n",
    "   - Your use of delimiters inspired the advanced input parsing techniques\n",
    "   - Example: Combining XML-like tags with markdown formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditional Logic Expansion**\n",
    "   - From your title evaluation prompt, we developed the multi-filter system\n",
    "   - Now with explicit test cases and targeted alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparative Analysis Framework**\n",
    "   - Your article comparison evolved into a full forensic analysis\n",
    "   - Added quantitative metrics alongside qualitative assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Use Case\n",
    "```\n",
    "Evaluate two product descriptions for:\n",
    "1. Key feature coverage\n",
    "2. Emotional appeal\n",
    "3. Call-to-action effectiveness\n",
    "Then synthesize an optimized version combining the best elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>Description A</div>\n",
    "<div>Description B</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Use Case\n",
    "```\n",
    "Process research paper submissions by:\n",
    "1. Extracting core contributions from \"\"\"Abstract\"\"\"\n",
    "2. Comparing to [Conference CFP] requirements\n",
    "3. Generating acceptance/rejection recommendation\n",
    "4. Providing revision suggestions if needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Creation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analyze these two blog posts about [topic]:\n",
    "1. Identify unique insights in each\n",
    "2. Detect any factual overlaps\n",
    "3. Assess readability metrics\n",
    "4. Create a merged outline preserving all unique value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pro Tips for Your Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Scoring Rubrics**\n",
    "   Enhance your title evaluation with:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "   - Accuracy (0-3 points)\n",
    "   - Creativity (0-2 points)\n",
    "   - Field-Specific Jargon (0-1 point)\n",
    "   Minimum 5/6 to pass, otherwise suggest alternatives\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Include Validation Steps**\n",
    "   Improve your summary comparison with:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Before comparing, verify:\n",
    "   1. All named entities are preserved\n",
    "   2. No new information was added\n",
    "   3. No key relationships were distorted\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Failure Cases**\n",
    "   Strengthen article comparison with:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If articles cover substantially different aspects:\n",
    "   - First identify the common ground\n",
    "   - Then analyze differences contextually\n",
    "   - Finally assess comparative value\n",
    "   ```\n"
