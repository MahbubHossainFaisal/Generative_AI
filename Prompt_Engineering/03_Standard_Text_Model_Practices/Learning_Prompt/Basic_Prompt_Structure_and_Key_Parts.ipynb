    "\t\t- Role (Persona)\n",

    "\t\t\n",
    "\t1. Best Practices for Directives:\n",
    "\t- Be clear and concise.\n",
    "\t- Avoid ambiguous or vague instructions.\n",
    "\t- When possible, use action verbs to indicate the specific task (e.g., \"write,\" \"list,\" \"translate\").\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t2. Examples\n",
    "\t- When the task is more complex, providing Examples can help guide the AI in producing more accurate responses.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- Examples demonstrate the expected format, style, or structure of the output. By including them in the prompt, \n",
    "\tyou can guide the AI's behavior and help it better understand the desired result.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t3. Role (Persona)\n",
    "\t- By telling the AI to act as an expert, a professional, or a specific character,\n",
    "\tyou can guide the tone, style, and content of the response.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- Best Practices for Using Roles:\n",
    "\t\t- Use roles to add expertise or a specific perspective to the response.\n",
    "\t\t- Ensure the role fits the task at hand (e.g., using a marketing expert to write promotional content).\n",
    "\t\t- Combine the role with additional context for better results.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t4. Output Formatting\n",
    "\t-  Output Formatting ensures that the response follows a particular structur-\n",
    "\twhether it's a list, a table, or a paragraph.\n",
    "\t- Style Instructions\n",
    "\tYou can also specify stylistic preferences, such as tone or length,\twithin the output formatting.\n",
    "\tThis allows you to control not just the content but how it's presented.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t5. Additional Information\n",
    "\t- It provides the background details the AI needs to generate a relevant response. \n",
    "\tIncluding this information ensures that the AI has a comprehensive understanding of the task and the necessary data to complete it.\n",
    "\t- Best Practices for Additional Information:\n",
    "\t- Include only relevant informationâ€”avoid overloading the prompt with unnecessary details.\n",
    "\t- Ensure the information is clearly linked to the task.\n",
    "\t- Use this element to provide essential background that the AI might not otherwise have.\n",
    "\t\n",

    "    - Role\n",
    "    - Directive\n",
    "    - Output Formatting\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tThe order of the elements affects how the AI processes the information.\n",
    "\tFor instance, placing the directive last helps avoid the AI continuing the additional information\n",
    "\tinstead of focusing on the task at hand.\n",
    "\tPlacing the directive at the end helps ensure the AI processes all the context before generating its response.\n",
    "\tThis minimizes the risk of the AI continuing to add context instead of focusing on the specified task.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- One Shot Prompting:\n",
    "\t- One-shot prompting involves giving the AI a single example before the task.\n",
    "\tThis clarifies the expected output and can improve accuracy for tasks that benefit from a sample demonstration."
