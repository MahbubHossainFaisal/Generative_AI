- Introduction to Prompt Engineering 
	- adding specificity, providing context, 
	and guiding the model with detailed instructions can significantly improve its responses.
	
- Basic Prompt Structure and Key Parts:
	- The key parts of a prompt are:

		- The Directive
		- Examples
		- Role (Persona)
		- Output Formatting
		- Additional Information
		
	1. Best Practices for Directives:
	- Be clear and concise.
	- Avoid ambiguous or vague instructions.
	- When possible, use action verbs to indicate the specific task (e.g., "write," "list," "translate").
	
	2. Examples
	- When the task is more complex, providing Examples can help guide the AI in producing more accurate responses.
	
	- Examples demonstrate the expected format, style, or structure of the output. By including them in the prompt, 
	you can guide the AI's behavior and help it better understand the desired result.
	
	3. Role (Persona)
	- By telling the AI to act as an expert, a professional, or a specific character,
	you can guide the tone, style, and content of the response.
	
	- Best Practices for Using Roles:
		- Use roles to add expertise or a specific perspective to the response.
		- Ensure the role fits the task at hand (e.g., using a marketing expert to write promotional content).
		- Combine the role with additional context for better results.
		
	4. Output Formatting
	-  Output Formatting ensures that the response follows a particular structur-
	whether it's a list, a table, or a paragraph.
	- Style Instructions
	You can also specify stylistic preferences, such as tone or length,	within the output formatting.
	This allows you to control not just the content but how it's presented.
	
	5. Additional Information
	- It provides the background details the AI needs to generate a relevant response. 
	Including this information ensures that the AI has a comprehensive understanding of the task and the necessary data to complete it.
	- Best Practices for Additional Information:
	- Include only relevant informationâ€”avoid overloading the prompt with unnecessary details.
	- Ensure the information is clearly linked to the task.
	- Use this element to provide essential background that the AI might not otherwise have.
	
	
- Order parts of the prompt:
	- Examples (if needed)
    - Additional Information
    - Role
    - Directive
    - Output Formatting
	
	The order of the elements affects how the AI processes the information.
	For instance, placing the directive last helps avoid the AI continuing the additional information
	instead of focusing on the task at hand.
	Placing the directive at the end helps ensure the AI processes all the context before generating its response.
	This minimizes the risk of the AI continuing to add context instead of focusing on the specified task.
	
	
- One Shot Prompting:
	- One-shot prompting involves giving the AI a single example before the task.
	This clarifies the expected output and can improve accuracy for tasks that benefit from a sample demonstration.
